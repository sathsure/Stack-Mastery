## 1. Core Concepts

### 1. What is RxJS?

**Answer:** A library for reactive programming using Observables to compose async and event-based programs in a functional style.

### 2. What is an Observable?

**Answer:** A lazy, push-based collection that emits values over time and notifies observers about `next`, `error`, and `complete`.

### 3. What is an Observer?

**Answer:** A set of callbacks (`next`, `error`, `complete`) that define how to react to Observable emissions.

### 4. What is a Subscription?

**Answer:** The object returned from `observable.subscribe(...)` that represents the execution; it can be used to unsubscribe.

### 5. What is an Operator in RxJS?

**Answer:** A pure function that takes an Observable as input and returns a new Observable as output (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`).

### 6. What’s the difference between `pipeable` and `creation` operators?

**Answer:**

- Creation: create Observables (`of`, `from`, `interval`, `timer`, `fromEvent`)
- Pipeable: modify/transform Observables (`map`, `filter`, `switchMap`, `catchError`), used with `.pipe()`.

### 7. Is an Observable lazy or eager?

**Answer:** Lazy. It doesn’t start producing values until someone subscribes.

### 8. Can Observables be synchronous?

**Answer:** Yes. They can be sync, async, or a mix, depending on how they’re implemented.

### 9. What are the three types of notifications an Observable can emit?

**Answer:** `next` (data), `error` (terminal), `complete` (terminal).

### 10. Can an Observable emit after `complete`?

**Answer:** No. After `complete` or `error`, it must not emit any more values.

## 2. Hot vs Cold, Multicasting & Subjects

### 11. What is a cold Observable?

**Answer:** Each subscription gets its own independent execution and source (e.g., `of`, `from`, `httpClient.get`).

### 12. What is a hot Observable?

**Answer:** The source is shared. Subscriptions tap into an ongoing execution (e.g., DOM events, WebSocket streams).

### 13. How do you convert a cold Observable to a hot one?

**Answer:** Multicasting: using `share`, `shareReplay`, `publish().refCount()`, or a Subject.

### 14. What is a Subject?

**Answer:** Both an Observable and an Observer; it can emit values to multiple subscribers.

### 15. Difference between `Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, and `AsyncSubject`?

**Answer:**

- `Subject`: no initial value, broadcasts new values.
- `BehaviorSubject`: holds current value, new subscribers get the latest value.
- `ReplaySubject`: replays a buffer of past values to new subscribers.
- `AsyncSubject`: emits only the last value on completion.

### 16. **Trick:** Does `BehaviorSubject` emit its current value immediately on subscription?

**Answer:** Yes, it synchronously emits the last/current value upon subscription.

### 17. **Trick:** Can a `Subject` emit values before anyone subscribes?

**Answer:** Yes, but those values are lost (no replay).

### 18. When would you use `shareReplay` in Angular?

**Answer:** To cache and share the latest emission (e.g., HTTP data) among multiple subscribers without refetching.

### 19. **Trick:** What’s a common memory leak pitfall with `shareReplay`?

**Answer:** Using `shareReplay({ refCount: false })` or old signature without refCount over infinite streams can keep subscriptions alive forever.

## 3. Key Operators (Transformation & Flattening)

### 20. What does `map` do?

**Answer:** Transforms each emitted value with a pure function, returning a new Observable.

### 21. What does `filter` do?

**Answer:** Emits only values that satisfy a predicate.

### 22. What is `tap` used for?

**Answer:** Side effects (logging, debugging) without changing the stream.

### 23. What does `scan` do?

**Answer:** Like `reduce` over time: accumulates values and emits each intermediate result.

### 24. What is the difference between `map` and `switchMap`?

**Answer:**

- `map`: transforms value to another value.
- `switchMap`: transforms value to an inner Observable and **switches** to it, cancelling previous inner subscriptions.

### 25. Explain `mergeMap`.

**Answer:** Maps each value to an inner Observable, subscribes to all inner Observables concurrently, and merges their outputs.

### 26. Explain `concatMap`.

**Answer:** Queues inner Observables and subscribes to them sequentially; each waits for the previous to complete.

### 27. Explain `exhaustMap`.

**Answer:** Ignores new source values while an inner Observable is active; resumes listening after inner completes.

### 28. **Trick:** For an autocomplete search, which is best: `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `concatMap`, or `exhaustMap`?

**Answer:** `switchMap`, because it cancels previous HTTP requests when new input arrives.

### 29. **Trick:** For a login button that must ignore double-clicks while a request is in flight, which flattening operator?

**Answer:** `exhaustMap`.

### 30. **Trick:** For processing a queue of tasks in order, one at a time?

**Answer:** `concatMap`.

## 4. Combination & Higher-order Operators

### 31. Difference between `combineLatest` and `forkJoin`?

**Answer:**

- `combineLatest`: emits whenever any source emits, using **latest values** from all; usually never completes if sources never complete.
- `forkJoin`: waits for all sources to complete and emits **one array** of last values, then completes.

### 32. Difference between `merge` and `concat`?

**Answer:**

- `merge`: interleaves emissions from sources concurrently.
- `concat`: subscribes to Observables sequentially; second starts after first completes.

### 33. What does `withLatestFrom` do?

**Answer:** Combines the source value with the latest values from other Observables each time the source emits.

### 34. Use case for `race`?

**Answer:** When you want to listen to several Observables but only care about the one that emits first.

## 5. Error Handling & Completion

### 35. How does `catchError` work?

**Answer:** Catches errors from upstream, lets you return a new Observable (fallback, default value, or rethrow).

### 36. Where should `catchError` be placed (before or after `retry`)?

**Answer:** Usually **before** terminal consumers and often _after_ `retry`. Typical pattern: `source.pipe(retry(3), catchError(...))`.

### 37. What does `retry` do?

**Answer:** Resubscribes to the source Observable on error a given number of times (or indefinitely).

### 38. Difference between `retry` and `repeat`?

**Answer:**

- `retry`: re-subscribe on **error**.
- `repeat`: re-subscribe on **completion**.

### 39. **Trick:** If you `catchError` and return `EMPTY`, does the stream complete?

**Answer:** Yes. `EMPTY` completes immediately.

### 40. What is `finalize` used for?

**Answer:** To run cleanup logic on `complete` or `error` (e.g., turn off a loading spinner).

---

## 6. Schedulers & Concurrency

### 41. What is a Scheduler?

**Answer:** A centralized way to control **when** and **where (which execution context)** Observable notifications are delivered.

### 42. Why might you use `observeOn(asyncScheduler)`?

**Answer:** To make a sync stream async (e.g., avoid blocking UI, change microtask/macrotask timing).

### 43. In Angular, how does RxJS interact with Zones and change detection?

**Answer:** Angular patches async APIs (including many RxJS sources) via Zone.js; emissions trigger change detection if they run inside the Angular zone. You can run outside zone for performance and manually trigger when needed.

## 7. Angular Integration (Senior-level)

### 44. How does Angular `HttpClient` use RxJS?

**Answer:** It returns cold Observables that complete after emitting the HTTP response.

### 45. **Trick:** If you subscribe twice to the same `this.http.get(...)`, how many HTTP calls happen?

**Answer:** Two. `HttpClient` Observables are cold; each subscription triggers a new request (unless shared).

### 46. How do you avoid multiple HTTP calls when many components need the same data?

**Answer:** Share the stream using `shareReplay`, store it in a service, and reuse the same Observable.

### 47. What does the `async` pipe do?

**Answer:** Subscribes to an Observable/Promise in a template, exposes latest value, and automatically unsubscribes on destroy.

### 48. When should you **NOT** use the `async` pipe?

**Answer:** When you need imperative control over subscription or side effects, or when the value is used in many places and you want a single shared subscription in TS.

### 49. How would you model component state using RxJS?

**Answer:** Use Subjects/BehaviorSubjects, `scan` or `withLatestFrom` to build state reducers, expose as Observables, and bind via `async` pipe.

### 50. Example: How to debounce a search input in Angular?

**Answer:** Use `FormControl.valueChanges.pipe(debounceTime(300), distinctUntilChanged(), switchMap(term => this.service.search(term)))`.

### 51. How does RxJS fit into NgRx?

**Answer:** NgRx store, actions, and effects are built on top of Observables; effects use RxJS operators (`ofType`, `mergeMap`, `switchMap`, `catchError`, etc.).

## 8. Memory Leaks & Best Practices

### 52. How do memory leaks occur with RxJS in Angular?

**Answer:** By not unsubscribing from **long-lived** or **infinite** Observables (e.g. `interval`, `fromEvent`) when components are destroyed.

### 53. Ways to avoid manual `unsubscribe`?

**Answer:**

- Use `async` pipe in templates.
- Use `takeUntil(destroy$)`.
- Use `take`, `first`, `takeWhile`.
- Use scoped libraries (`takeUntilDestroyed` in newer Angular).

### 54. Which streams generally do **not** need manual unsubscribe?

**Answer:** Finite Observables that complete (e.g. single HTTP calls) and streams managed by `async` pipe.

### 55. **Trick:** Does a `BehaviorSubject` with no subscribers cause a memory leak by itself?

**Answer:** Not by itself; but if it holds large objects or references, they stay in memory as long as the Subject is referenced.

## 9. Trick / Gotcha Questions

### 56. **Trick:** Does `subscribe` return a Promise?

**Answer:** No. It returns a `Subscription`. To get a Promise, use `firstValueFrom` or `lastValueFrom`.

### 57. **Trick:** If you call `unsubscribe()` on a completed stream, what happens?

**Answer:** Nothing special; completion already cleaned up. Calling `unsubscribe` again is a no-op.

### 58. **Trick:** Will `map` be executed if no one subscribes?

**Answer:** No. Operators are applied only when there is a subscription.

### 59. **Trick:** Does `tap` change the emitted values?

**Answer:** No. It is for side effects; it passes through the original values.

### 60. **Trick:** `interval(1000).pipe(take(0))` — does it emit anything?

**Answer:** No. It completes immediately with zero emissions.

### 61. **Trick:** Does `combineLatest([a$, b$])` emit if `a$` emits but `b$` has never emitted?

**Answer:** No. It waits until **each** source has emitted at least once.

### 62. **Trick:** Can `catchError` swallow an error and keep the outer stream alive?

**Answer:** Yes, if it returns a new Observable that doesn’t error.

### 63. **Trick:** `from([1,2,3]).pipe(switchMap(x => of(x)))` — can any values be “cancelled”?

**Answer:** No, because inner Observables complete synchronously; `switchMap` doesn’t have time to cancel.

### 64. **Trick:** `share()` vs `shareReplay(1)` for HTTP caching?

**Answer:** `share()` only shares among **current** subscribers; late subscribers won’t get the last value. `shareReplay(1)` lets late subscribers receive the cached last emission.

### 65. **Trick:** What happens if you call `next` on a completed `Subject`?

**Answer:** It does nothing; subscribers don’t receive anything after completion.

## 10. Scenario / Mock Questions (Senior-level)

### 66. Mock: You have an infinite WebSocket stream. Some components need the stream; others don’t. How do you design it?

**Answer:** Wrap WebSocket in a service, create a Subject or `share`/`shareReplay` Observable, manage connection at service level, and expose a hot shared stream to components.

### 67. Mock: You have a file upload progress API that emits progress %. You must show progress and allow cancel. RxJS approach?

**Answer:** Use HTTP with `reportProgress`, map events to % using `scan`/`map`, and use a `Subject` as a cancel notifier combined with `takeUntil(cancel$)`.

### 68. Mock: You need to poll a backend every 10s, but stop when user navigates away or an error happens. How?

**Answer:** `timer(0, 10000).pipe(switchMap(() => http.get(...)), takeUntil(routeDestroyed$), catchError(err => { stop / notify; return EMPTY; }))`.

### 69. Mock: You must combine user preferences from backend and local overrides from UI. How would you model with RxJS?

**Answer:** `combineLatest([backendPrefs$, uiOverrides$]).pipe(map(([b, u]) => ({...b, ...u})))`.

### 70. Mock: You have three dependent HTTP calls (B depends on A, C depends on B). Implementation?

**Answer:** Chain with `switchMap` or `concatMap`:

```ts
this.http.get<A>(...).pipe(
  switchMap(a => this.http.get<B>(`/b/${a.id}`)),
  switchMap(b => this.http.get<C>(`/c/${b.id}`))
);
```

### 71. Mock: You need to debounce keystrokes, but execute immediately on Enter key. Pattern?

**Answer:** Merge two streams:

- `valueChanges.pipe(debounceTime(...), distinctUntilChanged(), ...)`
- `enterKey$.pipe(withLatestFrom(valueChanges), map(([, val]) => val))`
  Then `merge` them.

### 72. Mock: You want to build a “wizard” where each step depends on the previous step’s result and can be retried. Operator choices?

**Answer:** Use `concatMap` for ordered steps, `catchError` for per-step retry logic, maybe a state stream with `scan`.
