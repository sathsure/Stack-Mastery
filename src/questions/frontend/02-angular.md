## 1. Architecture & Core Concepts

### ❓ 1. What is Angular, and how is it different from AngularJS?

📝 **Answer:**

Angular is a TypeScript-based framework (2+) with component-based architecture, ahead-of-time compilation, RxJS, and modern tooling; AngularJS (1.x) is JavaScript-based, uses scopes/controllers, and a different change detection mechanism (dirty checking).

### ❓ 2. Explain the role of NgModules vs Components.

📝 **Answer:**

NgModules group related code (components, directives, pipes, services) into cohesive blocks; components control views and handle UI logic. With standalone APIs, modules are optional for many scenarios, but still exist for features like `RouterModule`.

### ❓ 3. What are standalone components? Why were they introduced?

📝 **Answer:**

Standalone components can be used without declaring them in an NgModule. They reduce boilerplate and make lazy-loading, code-splitting, and feature isolation easier.

### ❓ 4. What is a feature module and why would you use it

📝 **Answer:**

A feature module encapsulates a specific domain/feature (e.g. `UserModule`). It helps with organization, reusability, and lazy loading.

### ❓ 5. What are the main building blocks of an Angular application

📝 **Answer:**

Modules, components, templates, metadata, services, dependency injection, directives, pipes, and routing.

## 2. Components, Templates & Data Binding

### ❓ 6. What are the different types of data binding in Angular

📝 **Answer:**

Interpolation (`{{ }}`), property binding (`[prop]`), event binding (`(event)`), and two-way binding (`[(ngModel)]`, or custom via `@Input` + `@Output`).

### ❓ 7. How do you implement a custom two-way binding for a component

📝 **Answer:**

Use an `@Input()` property like `value` and an `@Output()` EventEmitter like `valueChange`. The parent uses `[(value)]="someVar"`.

### ❓ 8. What is the difference between `ngOnInit` and the constructor in a component

📝 **Answer:**

Constructor is for basic initialization and DI. `ngOnInit` is part of Angular’s lifecycle and is called after inputs are resolved and the first `ngOnChanges` runs.

### ❓ 9. How do you pass data from parent to child and child to parent?

📝 **Answer:**

Parent to child: `@Input()` properties. Child to parent: `@Output()` EventEmitters.

### ❓ 10. What is `ViewChild` and when would you use it?

📝 **Answer:**

`@ViewChild` gives you a reference to a child component/directive or template element in the same view. You use it to interact with child APIs directly (e.g. focus, call methods).

### ❓ 11. Trick: Can you access a `@ViewChild` in the constructor?

📝 **Answer:**

No. It’s only reliably available in `ngAfterViewInit` (or later), not in the constructor.

---

## 3. Directives & Pipes

### ❓ 12. Difference between components and directives?

📝 **Answer:**

A component is a directive with a template. Directives without templates are used to modify behavior/appearance of existing elements.

### ❓ 13. What’s the difference between structural and attribute directives?

📝 **Answer:**

Structural directives change the DOM layout (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`). Attribute directives change appearance/behavior of an existing element (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`, custom ones).

### ❓ 14. Why is there an asterisk in `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`?

📝 **Answer:**

It’s syntactic sugar for using `<ng-template>`; Angular desugars it into an underlying template structure.

### ❓ 15. What is a pure pipe vs impure pipe?

📝 **Answer:**

Pure pipes run only when input references change. Impure pipes run on every change detection cycle; they can handle mutable data but impact performance.

### ❓ 16. Trick: Why is using an impure pipe on large lists risky?

📝 **Answer:**

Because it executes on every change detection run and can dramatically slow rendering.

---

## 4. Change Detection, Zones & Signals

### ❓ 17. Explain Angular’s change detection mechanism.

📝 **Answer:**

Angular walks the component tree and checks bindings. By default, `Zone.js` patches async APIs to know when to trigger change detection.

### ❓ 18. What is the difference between `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` and `OnPush`?

📝 **Answer:**

`Default` runs change detection for a component whenever any ancestor runs. `OnPush` only checks when input references change, an event originates in the component, or Observable/Promise emits via async pipe, etc.

### ❓ 19. Trick: In an `OnPush` component, will mutating an array (e.g. `arr.push()`) trigger a view update?

📝 **Answer:**

Not automatically. You must provide a new reference (e.g. `arr = [...arr, newItem]`) or manually mark for check.

### ❓ 20. What is `ChangeDetectorRef` and when do you use it?

📝 **Answer:**

It allows fine-grained control over change detection (marking views for check, detaching, reattaching). Useful in performance-sensitive components or when integrating with non-Angular APIs.

### ❓ 21. What are Angular signals (if you’ve used them)?

📝 **Answer:**

Signals are reactive primitives that hold a value and notify dependents when the value changes, offering a more explicit and fine-grained reactivity model than Zone-based change detection.

### ❓ 22. Trick: Does changing a signal value in a service automatically update all consuming components?

📝 **Answer:**

Yes, any computed views or effects using that signal re-run, updating the UI where it’s read.

---

## 5. Dependency Injection & Providers

### ❓ 23. How does Angular’s DI hierarchy work?

📝 **Answer:**

Providers can be registered in modules, components, or via `providedIn`. The injector tree mirrors the component/module tree; a child injector falls back to parent injectors when resolving dependencies.

### ❓ 24. Difference between `providedIn: 'root'` and `providedIn: 'any'`?

📝 **Answer:**

`'root'` creates a singleton service in the root injector. `'any'` creates a new instance in each lazy-loaded module or component injector where it’s requested.

### ❓ 25. What’s a multi-provider and when would you use it?

📝 **Answer:**

A multi-provider allows multiple values for the same token (e.g. multiple `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS`). You declare `multi: true` in the provider.

### ❓ 26. Trick: If you provide the same service in a lazy-loaded module and in root, how many instances exist?

📝 **Answer:**

Two: one in the root injector, and a separate one in the lazy module’s injector.

### ❓ 27. What are injection tokens and why are they needed?

📝 **Answer:**

`InjectionToken` is used to inject values that don’t have a class type (e.g. config objects, interfaces). It provides a DI key for non-class dependencies.

---

## 6. Routing & Navigation

### ❓ 28. Core concepts of Angular routing?

📝 **Answer:**

Routes config, router outlet, routerLink/routerLinkActive, route guards, lazy loading, resolvers, `ActivatedRoute`.

### ❓ 29. What are route guards and types available?

📝 **Answer:**

Guards control navigation. Types: `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, `CanLoad` / `CanMatch`, etc.

### ❓ 30. Difference between `CanLoad`/`CanMatch` and `CanActivate`?

📝 **Answer:**

`CanActivate` runs after module is loaded to allow/deny activation. `CanLoad`/`CanMatch` runs before loading, preventing the lazy module bundle from being loaded if not allowed.

### ❓ 31. Explain lazy loading modules / routes.

📝 **Answer:**

Lazy-loaded routes use dynamic imports in route config (e.g. `loadChildren:` or standalone `loadComponent`), so code is loaded on demand.

### ❓ 32. Trick: If you have a service provided in a lazy-loaded module, is it shared with the rest of the app?

📝 **Answer:**

No. That service instance is scoped to that lazy module’s injector (unless explicitly provided at root).

### ❓ 33. How do you access route params and query params?

📝 **Answer:**

Using `ActivatedRoute`: `route.paramMap`, `route.snapshot.paramMap`, `route.queryParamMap`, etc.

---

## 7. Forms (Template-Driven & Reactive)

### ❓ 34. Differences between template-driven and reactive forms?

📝 **Answer:**

Template-driven: form logic in template, simpler, uses `ngModel`. Reactive: form model in TypeScript, more explicit, scalable, and testable using `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, `FormArray`.

### ❓ 35. What is a `FormGroup` and `FormControl`?

📝 **Answer:**

`FormControl` represents a single value and validation state. `FormGroup` is a collection of controls, acting like an object model.

### ❓ 36. How do you create a custom form control compatible with Angular forms?

📝 **Answer:**

Implement `ControlValueAccessor` and optionally `Validator` to integrate with the forms API and be used with `formControlName`/`ngModel`.

### ❓ 37. Trick: Why is using `[(ngModel)]` with reactive forms generally discouraged?

📝 **Answer:**

It mixes paradigms and can cause confusion and unexpected behavior. You should stick to one approach, usually reactive forms for complex forms.

## 8. HTTP, Interceptors & Error Handling

### ❓ 38. What is `HttpClient` and advantages over old `Http` module?

📝 **Answer:**

`HttpClient` returns typed, observable responses, handles JSON automatically, supports interceptors, easier configuration.

### ❓ 39. What are HTTP interceptors used for?

📝 **Answer:**

To inspect/modify requests and responses globally (e.g. auth headers, logging, error handling, retries).

### ❓ 40. Trick: In what order do multiple interceptors execute?

📝 **Answer:**

They execute in the order they are provided for outgoing requests, and in reverse order for incoming responses.

### ❓ 41. How do you handle global HTTP errors?

📝 **Answer:**

Use an interceptor to catch errors in `catchError`, and possibly a global error handler (`ErrorHandler`) for non-HTTP errors.

---

## 9. State Management & RxJS Integration

### ❓ 42. How do you usually handle application-wide state in Angular?

📝 **Answer:**

Options: services with RxJS (BehaviorSubject, signals), NgRx, Akita, NGXS, or custom state management patterns.

### ❓ 43. When would you prefer NgRx over simple services with subjects/signals?

📝 **Answer:**

For large, complex apps that need predictable, testable state changes, time-travel debugging, and strict one-way data flow.

### ❓ 44. Trick: Is `async` pipe unsubscribing automatically a replacement for manual unsubscribe in all cases?

📝 **Answer:**

Only in templates. Subscriptions created in code (e.g. in `ngOnInit`) must still be manually managed/unsubscribed.

### ❓ 45. How do you avoid multiple HTTP calls when multiple subscribers listen to the same Observable?

📝 **Answer:**

Use sharing operators like `shareReplay` or convert to a signal/store, or cache results in services.

---

## 10. Performance & Optimization

### ❓ 46. What techniques do you use for Angular performance optimization?

📝 **Answer:**

`OnPush` change detection, trackBy in `*ngFor`, lazy loading routes/components, preloading strategies, pure pipes, avoiding heavy work in templates, memoization, CDRef control.

### ❓ 47. Why is `trackBy` important for `*ngFor`?

📝 **Answer:**

It helps Angular identify items uniquely, so it reuses DOM elements instead of destroying/recreating them, improving performance on large lists.

### ❓ 48. Trick: What happens if you mutate the array used in `*ngFor` without a `trackBy`?

📝 **Answer:**

Angular may re-render many list items unnecessarily, causing poor performance.

### ❓ 49. How would you analyze performance issues in an Angular app?

📝 **Answer:**

Use Angular DevTools, browser performance profiler, change detection profiling, logging of lifecycle hooks, and analyzing network/bundle size.

### ❓ 50. What is AOT compilation and why is it useful?

📝 **Answer:**

Ahead-of-time compiles Angular templates during build, reducing bundle size, catching template errors early, and improving startup time.

## 11. SSR, Hydration & SEO

### ❓ 51. What is Angular Universal?

📝 **Answer:**

A solution for server-side rendering (SSR) Angular apps to improve first paint and SEO for crawlers.

### ❓ 52. What is hydration in Angular?

📝 **Answer:**

The process of reusing server-rendered DOM on the client and “wiring it up” to Angular, reducing re-rendering on startup.

### ❓ 53. Trick: Why might you still need `meta` tags service even with SSR?

📝 **Answer:**

Dynamic pages or client-side navigation need meta tags updated after initial load for social previews and some crawlers.

---

## 12. Security

### ❓ 54. How does Angular help protect against XSS?

📝 **Answer:**

By default, it sanitizes values in templates and escapes interpolated strings; it also has `DomSanitizer` for safe bypass in controlled situations.

### ❓ 55. What is `DomSanitizer` and when should you use it?

📝 **Answer:**

Service to mark trusted HTML/URLs/styles as safe. Use sparingly when you’re certain data is safe, e.g. from trusted sources.

### ❓ 56. Trick: Is binding to `[innerHTML]` always safe?

📝 **Answer:**

No. It’s a common XSS vector if you bind untrusted input. Only use with sanitized/trusted content.

---

## 13. Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E)

### ❓ 57. How do you test components in Angular?

📝 **Answer:**

With TestBed to configure testing module, create component fixture, interact with DOM, and assert outputs.

### ❓ 58. What’s the difference between shallow tests and integrated tests in Angular?

📝 **Answer:**

Shallow: test component in isolation with mocked child components/services. Integrated: include real child components, services, and possibly routing.

### ❓ 59. How do you test an Angular service that uses HttpClient?

📝 **Answer:**

Use `HttpClientTestingModule` and `HttpTestingController` to mock and assert HTTP calls.

### ❓ 60. Trick: Why is it a bad idea to rely heavily on `fakeAsync` for all async testing?

📝 **Answer:**

It can hide real timing issues and doesn’t handle all async sources gracefully (e.g. some timers or external APIs). Use `async`/`waitForAsync` or Observables where appropriate.

---

## 14. Build, Tooling & Versioning

### ❓ 61. What role does the Angular CLI play?

📝 **Answer:**

It scaffolds projects, generates code, builds/serves apps, runs tests and linting, and manages configurations.

### ❓ 62. How do you configure different environments (dev, QA, prod)?

📝 **Answer:**

Through environment files and build configurations; or via runtime configuration (e.g. loading JSON config on startup).

### ❓ 63. What is `ngZone: 'noop'` mode and when might you use it?

📝 **Answer:**

It disables Zone.js-based auto change detection. You then trigger detection manually; useful for high-performance use cases or integrating with other reactive systems.

---

## 15. Design, Patterns & Best Practices

### ❓ 64. How do you structure a large Angular project?

📝 **Answer:**

By domain/feature modules or feature folders, shared/core modules, clear layering (components → services → data layer), consistent naming, and enforcing boundaries.

### ❓ 65. How do smart vs dumb (container vs presentational) components help?

📝 **Answer:**

Smart components handle data fetching and state; dumb components focus on UI and inputs/outputs. This improves reusability and testability.

### ❓ 66. Trick: When is a service NOT a singleton in Angular?

📝 **Answer:**

When it’s provided in a component or in a lazy-loaded module, rather than in root; then each component/module gets its own instance.

### ❓ 67. What are some anti-patterns you watch out for in Angular code?

📝 **Answer:**

Business logic in components instead of services, massive god components, heavy logic in templates, subscriptions without unsubscribe, using `any` everywhere, too many global singletons.
