## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

### ❓ 1. Can you clearly explain the difference between authentication and authorization, and how both are implemented in a real MEAN stack application?

📝 **Answer**

Authentication is the process of **verifying the identity of a user**.
It confirms that the user is genuinely who they claim to be, typically using credentials such as username/password, OTP, or OAuth tokens.

Authorization happens **after authentication** and determines **what actions or resources the authenticated user is allowed to access**.

In a real MEAN application:

- Authentication usually happens during login
- Authorization is checked on **every protected API call**

If authentication is implemented without proper authorization, any authenticated user could access sensitive endpoints, which is a major security flaw.

### Example Explanation

When a user logs in successfully, the backend knows:

> “This request belongs to user ID 42.”

Authorization then decides:

> “Is user ID 42 allowed to delete users or view admin data?”

### Code Example

```js
// Authentication middleware
function authenticate(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "User not authenticated" });
  }
  next();
}

// Authorization middleware
function authorize(role) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user.role !== role) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied" });
    }
    next();
  };
}

app.delete("/admin/user/:id", authenticate, authorize("admin"), handler);
```

#### ❓ If a user is authenticated, does that mean they are authorized?

No. Authentication only proves identity. Authorization is required to determine **what the authenticated user can do**. Both must exist together.

### ❓ 2. Explain localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, and server sessions. When should each be used?

**localStorage** stores data permanently in the browser and is accessible through JavaScript. It should never store sensitive data because it is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**sessionStorage** is similar but scoped to a single browser tab and cleared when the tab is closed. It still suffers from XSS vulnerabilities.

**Cookies** are automatically sent with every HTTP request. When marked as HTTP-only, they are inaccessible to JavaScript, which improves security. However, cookies are vulnerable to CSRF if not protected.

**Server sessions** store data on the backend and send only a session ID to the browser. This is the most secure option but requires proper scaling using Redis or a shared store.

#### Why not store JWT in localStorage since it is easy?

Storing JWT in localStorage exposes it to XSS attacks. Any injected script can steal the token and impersonate the user. For production systems, JWT should be stored in HTTP-only cookies.

### ❓ 3. Is JWT secure? Many people say JWT is insecure.

📝 **Answer**

![Image](https://assets.bytebytego.com/diagrams/0155-cookies-vs-sessions-vs-jwt-vs-paseto.png)

JWT itself is not insecure. It is simply a signed token format.
Security problems arise from **how and where the token is stored**.

JWT stored in:

- localStorage → vulnerable to XSS
- sessionStorage → vulnerable to XSS
- HTTP-only cookies → significantly safer

The most secure modern approach is:

> JWT stored in HTTP-only, secure cookies with CSRF protection

This provides:

- Stateless authentication
- XSS protection
- Controlled CSRF defense

#### JWT completely removes the need for CSRF protection, right?

JWT is immune to CSRF **only when it is not stored in cookies**.
If JWT is stored in cookies, CSRF protection is still required.

### ❓ 4. Explain the complete JWT authentication flow including refresh tokens.

📝 **Answer**

1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. Server issues a short-lived access token
4. Server issues a long-lived refresh token
5. Access token is used for API calls
6. When access token expires, client requests new token
7. Refresh token is validated
8. New access token is issued
9. Refresh token is rotated for security

### ❓ 5. Explain CSRF with a real example and how you protect against it.

📝 **Answer**

CSRF occurs when a malicious website tricks a logged-in user's browser into sending a request to a trusted site. Since cookies are automatically included, the server cannot distinguish between legitimate and forged requests.

### Protection Strategy

- Generate CSRF token
- Send it to frontend
- Require token for state-changing requests
- Validate token server-side

```js
const csrf = require("csurf");
app.use(csrf());
```

### ❓ 6. Explain XSS and why it is considered one of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities.

📝 **Answer**

![Image](https://www.inspectiv.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Inspectiv_December2022/images/61cccea250b8fe03e2c3aec2_Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-7.52.57-AM.png?height=374&name=61cccea250b8fe03e2c3aec2_Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-7.52.57-AM.png&width=547)

XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim’s browser. This can lead to:

- Session hijacking
- Token theft
- Unauthorized actions
- Malware injection

#### Vulnerable Code

```js
element.innerHTML = userInput;
```

#### Secure Code

```js
element.textContent = userInput;
```

### ❓ 7. What is CORS and why is it not real backend security?

📝 **Answer**

![Image](https://portswigger.net/web-security/images/attack-on-cors.svg)

CORS is a browser-enforced mechanism that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests.
It does not protect APIs from direct attacks such as Postman or curl.
Backend security must rely on authentication and authorization, not CORS alone.

---

### ❓ 8. Explain hashing, salting, and peppering in password security.

📝 **Answer**

Hashing converts passwords into irreversible values.
Salting adds a unique random value per password to prevent rainbow table attacks.
Peppering adds a secret value stored outside the database, protecting against database leaks.

```js
bcrypt.hash(password + PEPPER, 12);
```

---

### ❓ 9. Is storing secrets in .env file safe in production?

📝 **Answer**

No. Environment files can leak through logs, container images, or CI pipelines.
Secrets should be managed using secure vault services such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

---

### ❓ 10. How do you secure authentication systems?

📝 **Answer**

- **HTTPOnly Cookies** prevent JavaScript access to tokens.
- **SameSite Cookies** protect against CSRF attacks.
- **CSRF Tokens** validate request origin.
- **Helmet** secures HTTP headers.
- **Rate Limiting** prevents brute-force attacks.
- **Password Hashing** ensures passwords are never stored in plaintext.
- **Salting** prevents rainbow table attacks.
- **Peppering** adds an application-level secret.
- **MFA / 2FA / OTP / TOTP** add extra verification layers.
- **RBAC, ABAC, PBAC** control access based on roles, attributes, or policies.
- **Nonce usage** prevents replay attacks.
- **Token expiration handling** ensures old tokens are invalidated properly.
- **API Keys & Basic Auth** are used for machine-to-machine communication.
